          Calling without saving a number is one of the best features of the FM
          Whatsapp app this means that you can call anybody without adding his
          or her number
        </p>
        <p>
          The forward tag can be disabled, most of us face issues while
          forwarding messages on official WhatsApp that forwarded text on top of
          the message looks annoying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Status view can be hidden and blue ticks can be disabled from the
          chat.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can view the messages and status even after the sender deletes them
          this is possible due to the anti-del message and status feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the official WhatsApp multimedia sharing options are very limited
          but in the case of FM WhatsApp, the user can share up to 700 MB of
          files at once.
        </p>
        <p>High-quality videos and images can be shared via FM Whatsapp.</p>

                You can use WhatsApp Web in FMWhatsapp but all the features of

              <p>
                Both the apps are great and include features absent from the
                official WhatsApp but the conclusion is that GB WhatsApp is more
                reliable to use. The only difference between them is the
                additional hacks and features provided by the GB WhatsApp. So GB
                WhatsApp is a good choice to choose between both of them.
