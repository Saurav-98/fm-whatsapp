                Enhanced Privacy Settings: Yo WhatsApp offers advanced privacy
                settings, allowing users to customize who can view their profile

            <h4>Disadvantages of Yo WhatsApp</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Unsupported by Official WhatsApp: Yo WhatsApp is not endorsed or
                supported by the official WhatsApp team. Therefore, it may lack

                version.
              </li>
              <li>
                Risk of Account Suspension: Since Yo WhatsApp is a modified
                version, there is a potential risk of account suspension or
                banning by WhatsApp if detected. Users should be cautious when
                using such modified applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                Compatibility Issues: Due to its unofficial nature, Yo WhatsApp
                may encounter compatibility issues with certain devices or
                operating systems, leading to performance problems or crashes.
