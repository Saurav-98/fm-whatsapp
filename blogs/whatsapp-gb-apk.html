            <ol>
              <li>
                Security Risks: Since GB WhatsApp is a modified version

                to the security and privacy of user data. It is advised to

              </li>

                Account Suspension: Using GB WhatsApp violates WhatsApp's terms
                of service, and as a result, there is a risk of account
                suspension or banning. WhatsApp actively detects and takes
                action against users utilizing modded versions.
